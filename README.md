# Do Bitcoin blocktimes depend on the weather in Texas?

Texas, US, may be seeing positive feedback between bitcoin miners and massive wind and solar build-out. Does weather in Texas measurably alter blocktimes? We have a look through these three notebooks.

`1.` Scrape Weather Data

`2.` Data preprocessing and temporally aligns bitcoin blocks with appropriately timed weather measurements.
- Bitcoin block information may be retrieved from online sources, or directly from one's own personal node as done here.

`3.` Simple model of the average blocktimes using Pymc's MCMC.
